# scene5

Babylon.js engine and sets up two scenes: scene1 and scene2.
Each scene contains a 3D object (a sphere in scene1 and a cube in scene2) with textures and animations.
Lighting and shadow generation are also configured for each scene.
There's a skybox created for both scenes to provide a nicer background.
GUI elements (a "Switch Scene" button) are added to switch between the scenes.
The code sets up event listeners for keyboard input to control the objects in each scene. (Arrows)
